### About Me
My name is Sewade Olaolu Ogun. I'm currently an NLP Engineer with [Proto](https://www.proto.cx/) where I create AI Customer Experience (AICX) chatbots for multilingual contact centers, focusing on African Languages. I will be finishing my [African Masters in Machine Intelligence](https://aimsammi.org/) (AMMI) by July at African Institute for Mathematical Sciences, sponsored by Facebook and Google. Before joining AMMI, I worked as a Predictive Engineer and also have a Bachelors degree in Electronics and Electrical Engineering.
