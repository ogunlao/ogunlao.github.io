## Sewade Olaolu Ogun, PhD
I hold a PhD in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence from [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre-inria-nancy-grand-est). I am looking out for new opportunities in my related areas of research.

My research areas include:
- Generative text-to-speech systems
- Automatic speech recognition systems
- Dataset curation and augmentation
- Large language models
